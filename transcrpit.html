        So if you've never solved a cube before it may seem impossibly hard <br />
        0:03 <br />
        But today I'll be teaching you a method that I used to teach many people who did not believe they'd ever be able to solve <br />
        0:09 <br />
        The cube and if anything along the way becomes unclear and you need more examples <br />
        0:12 <br />
        Then you can check the example solve which I have a link to in the description <br />
        0:16 <br />
        With that being said it's time for you to solve your first cube <br />
        0:21 <br />
        So the first thing you do is find the white centerpiece and hold that on top next what you do is solve the white cross <br />
        0:27 <br />
        But we also need the colors on the side to line up. So here's how you do <br />
        0:30 <br />
        It find a white piece on the bottom layer like this one, but not this one. This one is a corner piece <br />
        0:36 <br />
        It has three colors on it. We want these ones these edge ones in the middle. So we're gonna take this one <br />
        0:41 <br />
        make sure you have the white on top take this piece from the bottom and just <br />
        0:44 <br />
        move it along the bottom until you find that it's underneath the <br />
        0:47 <br />
        Correct colored Center because this one's white and green and this one is a green Center <br />
        0:51 <br />
        So then what you do once is there is just move it up to the top by turning the green face <br />
        0:56 <br />
        180 degrees so basically just do that until you solve the entire white cross and these colors on the side also line up <br />
        1:02 <br />
        But I'm going to show you what might happen that will be a bit tricky <br />
        1:05 <br />
        So here I have found a white and orange piece <br />
        1:08 <br />
        So I will move it down along the bottom until it's under the orange Center and then turn it 180 degrees <br />
        1:13 <br />
        Till it's on the top, but these colors should be switched <br />
        1:16 <br />
        so what you do in this case is move this over to the side here like this and then <br />
        1:21 <br />
        Turn the top <br />
        1:23 <br />
        Counterclockwise move this up here. And then <br />
        1:26 <br />
        Put everything back and lastly what could happen is you're looking for the last piece of the cross and it's not anywhere on the bottom <br />
        1:33 <br />
        It might be in the middle here. So if it's in the middle, what you can do is just move it into the bottom <br />
        1:37 <br />
        We'll move it down into the bottom move it out of the way so that we can fix this cross piece <br />
        1:42 <br />
        And now you can just solve it as usual <br />
        1:45 <br />
        Alright once you've solved the whole cross make sure all these side colors match up with the Centers as well then just turn the cube <br />
        1:51 <br />
        upside down <br />
        1:52 <br />
        So now I'm going to teach you a really important sequence of 4 moves that will help you with everything else in the cube <br />
        1:57 <br />
        So just hold the cube like I am put your left thumb on the front here and then put your right thumb on the bottom <br />
        2:01 <br />
        Fingers up here and then do this turn the right side up try the top with your right hand like that <br />
        2:07 <br />
        Turn the right side down and then turn the top with your left hand like this <br />
        2:11 <br />
        Now just repeat that. So right-side up push with the right hand right side down push with left hand <br />
        2:20 <br />
        So do it a few times so you can do it quick and now we're also going to be learning how to do that with <br />
        2:24 <br />
        Our left hand because it's going to be important as well <br />
        2:26 <br />
        So hold your left hand like this right thumb on front and then move up with your left hand push with your left hand <br />
        2:32 <br />
        Move down and push with your right hand up push with the left down push with right <br />
        2:41 <br />
        Ok, so once you can do both of those we're now going to be solving the rest of the white side <br />
        2:45 <br />
        So what you have to do is look at the top for a corner with white on it such as this one and then look <br />
        2:50 <br />
        At the other colors on it as well. This is green. And this is orange. So these three make up one piece <br />
        2:54 <br />
        And so we have to look at where that needs to go <br />
        2:56 <br />
        So it goes between the whites green and orange centers white orange green, so it goes over here <br />
        3:04 <br />
        so we're gonna move the top until it goes right on top of where it should go and <br />
        3:08 <br />
        then now you can insert this into here using two different ways and <br />
        3:12 <br />
        one way is by holding it on the right side like this and then doing the right hand 4 moves 1 2 3 4 and <br />
        3:19 <br />
        Oh, it just happened to be solved. But sometimes you'll have to repeat it before it ends up being solved <br />
        3:24 <br />
        So here's another example, here's white green red. So that goes between white green and red centers <br />
        3:30 <br />
        So we're gonna move the top until it goes right up above where it should go and then we're going to repeat those moves <br />
        3:35 <br />
        But this time was on the left side so we could actually do that with our left hand. So <br />
        3:40 <br />
        once <br />
        3:41 <br />
        Not solved yet twice <br />
        3:44 <br />
        3 times and there we go <br />
        3:47 <br />
        Now something that might happen is you have a corner that's stuck on the bottom here and you need to take it out in order <br />
        3:51 <br />
        To keep solving. So if that happens you can just hold it here and then take it out using the same moves so like and <br />
        3:58 <br />
        Then you can just go on as usual <br />
        4:01 <br />
        Okay, so once you've done that for every corner then just check to make sure all these colors here are also correct and then we're <br />
        4:06 <br />
        gonna go on to the second layer, so <br />
        4:08 <br />
        this part <br />
        4:10 <br />
        So since the top center here is yellow <br />
        4:12 <br />
        Your first job is to find an edge piece one of these pieces on the top that don't have yellow on it in this case <br />
        4:18 <br />
        It's going to be this one over here. It's got blue and orange <br />
        4:20 <br />
        So just put it on the front and then move it around so that it matches up with the center <br />
        4:26 <br />
        now this is orange and blue so <br />
        4:29 <br />
        blues on the right <br />
        4:30 <br />
        greens on the left for the center's so since it's orange and blue it needs to go over to the right side it needs to <br />
        4:36 <br />
        Go over here. So since it needs to go to the right <br />
        4:38 <br />
        The first thing we're actually going to do is move it away move it towards the left side like that <br />
        4:42 <br />
        Then what we do this you'll just have to memorize take this corner out using your right hand <br />
        4:47 <br />
        So again using those four moves that I taught earlier 1 2 3 4 now we're going to reinsert this corner <br />
        4:54 <br />
        But using our left hand so like this 1 2 3 4 and then there we go <br />
        5:00 <br />
        And then another example here. We have a non yellow edge on top <br />
        5:03 <br />
        It's got red and blue so match up the front color red with the red Center and this has blue on it <br />
        5:10 <br />
        So the right side is green. The left side is blue. So it must be going to the left side <br />
        5:13 <br />
        So it means to go to the left side you follow the same rules as before just the other way <br />
        5:18 <br />
        so if you need to go to the left push to the right first like that and then <br />
        5:22 <br />
        take out this left corner with your left hand and <br />
        5:26 <br />
        Then put it back in using your right hand. So make sure you're holding it like this <br />
        5:30 <br />
        and <br />
        5:31 <br />
        There we go. So just like what the corners if you find that an edge is already in there <br />
        5:35 <br />
        Just take another piece such as like any random piece and then put it in there <br />
        5:38 <br />
        So you should know how to put pieces in there <br />
        5:40 <br />
        And then this one will come out and then you can just do it as usual after that <br />
        5:45 <br />
        All right. So once you finish the first two layers next we'll be doing the top cross the yellow cross <br />
        5:50 <br />
        so we're just looking at the edges and if you see that you have no edges already done then it's just a dot and then <br />
        5:56 <br />
        What you do is you turn the front clockwise like this then do the right handed four moves that I taught earlier <br />
        6:02 <br />
        So 1 2 3 4 and then undo that front move <br />
        6:07 <br />
        We're gonna ignore the corners here <br />
        6:08 <br />
        If you see that you have like an L shape then put that on the top left and then do it again <br />
        6:14 <br />
        so like this and then 4 moves and <br />
        6:18 <br />
        Then I'm do so now if you get a horizontal line <br />
        6:21 <br />
        Make sure you're not holding a vertical if it's horizontal then you would just do that again <br />
        6:30 <br />
        Once the cross is done just like with the first cross <br />
        6:32 <br />
        We want to try and line up as many pieces as we can <br />
        6:34 <br />
        So here I've lined up green and orange, but I have not lined up the other two <br />
        6:38 <br />
        So you're either going to be able to line up all four in which case great <br />
        6:42 <br />
        You're done (with) the step or you can only line up two. So you want to hold these two solved ones <br />
        6:46 <br />
        So that one's at the back and one's at the right now <br />
        6:48 <br />
        If you can't do that <br />
        6:50 <br />
        If they are across from each other then just do this algorithm from anywhere and this algorithm goes like this <br />
        6:54 <br />
        So you move the right side up you move this pair of pieces pay attention to this pair. You move it to the left <br />
        7:00 <br />
        And you put the red side back down <br />
        7:01 <br />
        then you keep moving this to the left all the way till it's on the very left side and <br />
        7:05 <br />
        Then you move the right side up again and put it all the way back in so like that <br />
        7:11 <br />
        Alright, so if you've done that correctly you should now be able to line up everything <br />
        7:19 <br />
        Is to get all of the corners into the correct spot <br />
        7:21 <br />
        So this one you can see it's yellow orange blue, and it's got yellow blue red centers around it <br />
        7:26 <br />
        So it's not in the right spot. This one's not in the right spot. This one is in the right spot yellow orange green <br />
        7:33 <br />
        Yellow orange green now if all of them are in the right spot already thing, you're done the step <br />
        7:38 <br />
        But if only one is correct, then hold it on the front, right? <br />
        7:41 <br />
        If none are correct, then just do this algorithm from anywhere and the algorithm goes like this <br />
        7:46 <br />
        Turn the top with your right hand right side up <br />
        7:49 <br />
        Same thing with your left hand turn with your left hand left side up now all the same thing again <br />
        7:54 <br />
        But downwards trying to top with your right hand right side down turn the top with your left hand left side down <br />
        7:59 <br />
        Alright, so this one's still in the right spot. So just keep your finger on that and check all the other ones and nope <br />
        8:04 <br />
        They're not in the right spot yet. So then just do it again <br />
        8:07 <br />
        Right hand right side up left hand left side up right hand right side down left hand left side down <br />
        8:14 <br />
        And then now every corner is in the right spot, but not necessarily flipped correctly as you can see from these two <br />
        8:21 <br />
        So every corner is in the right spot now and so once you get to this step you should turn everything upside down <br />
        8:27 <br />
        So get all these corners in the bottom later and now we're just gonna solve them one by one <br />
        8:31 <br />
        But make sure you pay attention to how this works because if you make a mistake, you could mess up the whole cube <br />
        8:35 <br />
        Okay, so we're gonna start by solving this bottom right corner <br />
        8:37 <br />
        So we're going to do those four moves with our right hand until this one is solved. So one <br />
        8:42 <br />
        two <br />
        8:44 <br />
        three <br />
        8:45 <br />
        Four and there it is. It's solved <br />
        8:48 <br />
        So once you've done that and start doing the next corner <br />
        8:50 <br />
        But make sure you bring the next corner over by turning the bottom layer don't rotate the whole cube or you'll mess things up <br />
        8:56 <br />
        So just turn the bottom layer over to get the next corner and then repeat <br />
        9:03 <br />
        And now that one's solved and so bring over the next one repeat <br />
        9:10 <br />
        This once solved to bring over the next one <br />
        9:13 <br />
        And then there you go. <br />
        9:18 <br />
        So if you're new to this channel <br />
        9:20 <br />
        What I do here is make tutorials on how to get faster at the Rubik's Cube as well as different things like blindfolded, one hand <br />
        9:26 <br />
        bigger cubes like four by four and five by five so you can check the description below for any of those videos as well as <br />
        9:31 <br />
        a video to a full example solve using the beginner method in case anything you think needs to be cleared up and if you have <br />
        9:37 <br />
        a question about anything you can leave it in the comments and I actually do reply to most of them and <br />
        9:41 <br />
        Lastly if you like what you see here and you'd like to support my channel then I really appreciate it if you checked out <br />
        9:46 <br />
        Patreon.com/J perm. So anyway, that's it. Thank you for watching and I'll see you guys next time. <br />
        9:51 <br />
        (All right. Now I'm doing a full example solved, but I assume you already have the general idea of how all these work <br />
        9:55 <br />
        So I'm just gonna go a little bit faster. So here I'm gonna try to solve the white cross orange is already done <br />
        10:01 <br />
        Here I have green--) <br />
